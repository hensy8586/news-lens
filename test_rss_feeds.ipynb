      "   Fulltext: \n",
      "\n",
      "EU suspends approval of US trade deal\n",
      "The European Parliament has suspended the approval of a key US trade deal agreed in July in protest at Donald Trump's demand to take over Greenland.\n",
      "The suspension was announced in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday, as the US president addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n",
      "The move marked a fresh escalation in tensions between the US and Europe, as Trump continues to threaten tariffs against European countries in his bid to acquire Greenland.\n",
      "Despite Trump ruling out the use of force to take control of the territory, the stand-off has rattled financial markets, reviving talk of a trade war and the possibility of retaliation against the US.\n",
      "Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.\n",
      "That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his \"Liberation Day\" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes at on the continent expected to boost US exports.\n",
      "The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official.\n",
      "But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was \"left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals\".\n",
      "He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold \"until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken\".\n",
      "Lange warned that Trump's actions had \"threatened the territorial integrity and sovereignty of an EU member state\", and that the European Parliament was showing its \"unshakable commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland\".\n",
      "In a press conference following the announcement, Lange said there will be \"no possibility for compromise\" until Trump's threats end and raised the prospect of the use of an \"anti-coercion instrument\" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\".\n",
      "It came after Manfred Weber, an influential German member of European Parliament, said \"approval is not possible at this stage\".\n",
      "Shares on both sides of the Atlantic had fallen on Tuesday, with European stock markets seeing a second day of losses.\n",
      "But those losses were recovered on Wednesday after Trump's promise not to use military force to take over Greenland.\n",
      "In the US, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all rose by around 1% in early trading on Wednesday. Meanwhile the FTSE 100 in London was around 0.25% higher.\n",
      "The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94.\n",
      "Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.\n",
      "Speaking in Davos, Trump had repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force\".\n",
      "However, he called for \"immediate negotiations\" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security.\n",
      "The decision to suspend the trade deal opens up questions about whether the EU will move forward with threats to retaliate against the US.\n",
      "The bloc had announced a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods that could be hit with levies last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs before putting the plan on hold, while the two sides finalised details of a deal.\n",
      "But that reprieve ends on 6 February, meaning EU levies will come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves for an extension or approves the new deal.\n",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is among those urging the EU to consider its retaliatory options, including the anti-coercion instrument, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\".\n",
      "Lange said he supports the move and that a decision on the use of the measure would be made on Monday.\n",
      "American response\n",
      "Also speaking in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his warning to European leaders against retaliation, urging them to \"have an open mind\".\n",
      "\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate,\" he said.\n",
      "The US has previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs.\n",
      "The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.\n",
      "When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe.\n",
      "In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead.\n",
      "Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.\n",
      "In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging.\n",
      "\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"\n",
      "Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. \n",

      "How North Carolina erased medical debt for 2.5 million people\n",
      "After a routine trip to her mailbox, Dawn Daly-Mack almost threw away an important letter that she thought was junk mail.\n",
      "\"I opened it up and it said, 'Your medical bill has been paid,'\" says Daly-Mack, 60, who lives in Gaston, in northeastern North Carolina. \"I didn't believe it.\"\n",
      "The letter turned out to be legitimate. Daly-Mack is one of about 2.5 million North Carolinians whose medical debt was erased under a new statewide agreement with hospitals. The hospital wiped away her $459 debt, dating back to a 2014 emergency room visit for a sinus infection.\n",
      "\"I was the only breadwinner in the family,\" says Daly-Mack, who was caring for her disabled husband and two teenagers at the time. \"I was not able to pay the bill.\"\n",
      "She was also working then as a nurse at the very same hospital trying to collect from her.\n",
      "Erasing and preventing medical debt\n",
      "All of the state's 99 hospitals agreed to stop collecting certain debts dating back to 2014. They also pledged going forward to automatically discount care for patients who qualify for financial assistance — without requiring them to apply. For a family of four, that means an annual income of less than $96,000 qualifies.\n",
      "\"I'm excited for the people of North Carolina,\" says Allison Sesso, CEO of Undue Medical Debt, a charity that uses donor money to buy and erase medical debt. \"It pairs not just medical debt relief going backwards, but it fixes the upstream problems.\"\n",
      "Hospitals worked with Sesso's team to identify who qualified for the relief and sent them letters.\n",
      "For Kody Kinsley, the former secretary of health in North Carolina, the issue was personal.\n",
      "\"My second year of college, my father had a massive stroke,\" says Kinsley. He says that his mom was very anxious about how to pay for his care: \"A key thought in her mind was, 'We don't have health insurance. Oh my God. We're gonna end up in debt.'\"\n",
      "Luckily, Kinsley figured out how to get a discount from the hospital.\n",
      "Years later as health secretary, Kinsley heard similar stories from all over the state. Even after 675,000 people gained Medicaid coverage through the new expansion in 2023, people would tell him about the old medical debt they still carried.\n",
      "\"They had a forward path, but they were still wrestling with that backward,\" he says.\n",
      "Kinsley crafted a plan to address that and prevent some patients from accumulating new debt. The state tied additional Medicaid dollars for hospitals to debt relief dating back to 2014 — the earliest date the state could have expanded the health insurance program. Hospitals also agreed to shift the burden of applying for financial assistance away from patients and automatically apply discounts.\n",
      "\"People can walk in the front door of a hospital in an [emergency] situation and not feel like they're taking both their health and their financial well-being at risk in that moment,\" Kinsley says.\n",
      "A patchwork of state approaches to medical debt\n",
      "Other states are taking action to tackle this $220 billion problem estimated to impact 1 in 12 Americans.\n",
      "Arizona and New Jersey used state dollars to buy and forgive medical debt. Oregon and Illinois screen patients for financial assistance. Colorado and New York ban medical debt from credit reports. The federal government recently rolled back that same protection.\n",
      "Heather Howard, director of Princeton University's State Health and Value Strategies program, is encouraged to see the flurry of actions but worries about how uneven the help is across the country.\n",
      "\"Your ZIP code is going to determine the protections you have,\" Howard says.\n",
      "She thinks to make a dent in this problem, federal rules are necessary. Especially as President Trump's health care policies are expected to lead to 14 million more people without insurance.\n",
      "\"We shouldn't be talking about a static problem,\" Howard says. \"This problem is going to grow.\"\n",
      "The looming Medicaid cuts and more people without health insurance mean hospitals are bracing for more unpaid care. The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represents hospitals, says those cuts could make \"sustaining these efforts more challenging.\" \n",

      "\"I'm not popular with you now because I'm defending Donald Trump, but I really believe you can be happy that he is there because he has forced us in Europe to step up, to face the consequences that we have to take care of more of our own defense,\" Rutte said at a panel discussion titled \"Can Europe defend itself?\" at the World Economic Forum. \n",

      "   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2026/jan/21/hand-shape-indonesia-cave-rock-art-67800-years-old\n",
      "   Fulltext: \n",
      "\n",
      "The faded outline of a hand on a cave wall in Indonesia may be the world’s oldest known rock art, according to archaeologists who say it was created at least 67,800 years ago.\n",
      "The ancient hand stencil was discovered in a limestone cave popular with tourists on Muna Island, part of south-eastern Sulawesi, where it had gone unnoticed between more recent paintings of animals and other figures.\n",
      "Beyond providing a minimum age for the cave art, the work furthers thinking on how and when Australia first became settled, with the stencil most likely created by the ancestors of Indigenous Australians.\n",
      "“There’s a lot of rock art out there but it’s really difficult to date,” said Prof Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Griffith University in Queensland. “When you can date it, it opens up a completely different world. It’s an intimate window into the past, and an intimate window into these people’s minds.”\n",
      "Fieldwork led by Aubert and Prof Adam Brumm, also at Griffith, has revealed a rich history of cave paintings in Sulawesi, mostly on the island’s south-western peninsula. In one cave, a narrative scene depicting three human-like figures and a wild pig was dated to at least 51,200 years ago.\n",
      "The latest hand stencil was spotted at Liang Metanduno, a cave on Sulawesi’s south-eastern peninsula. Though faded and partially obscured by a more recent motif on the wall, it was ascribed a minimum age after the team dated tiny calcite deposits that had formed over the top. Humans have painted in the cave for millennia, with fresh images adorning the walls for at least 35,000 years.\n",
      "It is unclear how humans first migrated from Sunda, the south-east Asian landmass that once connected Borneo, Sumatra and Java, to Sahul, which connected Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. But the rock art suggests some humans travelled on a northern route that crossed Sulawesi.\n",
      "Because sea levels were much lower at the time, land bridges opened up between some neighbouring islands, but humans would still have needed to island hop to spread across the region. Researchers contest when humans reached Sahul, but Brumm believes the rock art supports evidence that northern Australia was settled at least 65,000 years ago.\n",
      "The hand stencils were made by spraying mouthfuls of ochre mixed with water over a hand pressed to the cave wall. Like some others on Sulawesi, the Liang Metanduno stencil has narrow, pointy fingers, which the researchers believe was an intentional modification.\n",
      "Brumm said: “Whether they resemble animal claws or more fancifully some human-animal creature that doesn’t exist, we don’t know, but there’s some sort of symbolic meaning behind them.”\n",
      "Writing in Nature, the authors argue that the tweaks to the hand stencil make the rock art “complex” and so probably the work of Homo sapiens, but other long-gone human species cannot be ruled out. Archaeologists working in Spanish caves have dated ochre wall markings, including hand stencils, to at least 64,000 years ago, making them the work of Neanderthals. The related but little known Denisovans occupied a vast area of Asia and reached as far as Indonesia.\n",
      "Prof Paul Pettitt, of Durham University, who worked on the Spanish cave markings, said it was not clear whether the pointy-fingered hand stencils in Sulawesi were made on purpose or simply caused by the creator moving their fingers. “To call this complex is rather over-interpreting the hand stencil,” he said.\n",
      "“In any case, Neanderthals were modifying hand stencils, so why this should be a behaviour restricted to Homo sapiens, and why other potential human groups such as the poorly understood Denisovans couldn’t have created it, is unclear,” he added. “Before writing grand narratives about the complexity and success of Homo sapiens, we really should consider other, potentially more interesting explanations of this fascinating phenomenon.” \n",

      "   Published: 2026-01-21T15:51:00+00:00\n",
      "   URL: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/21/trump-american-democracy\n",
      "   Fulltext: \n",
      "\n",
      "Three hundred and sixty-five days after Donald Trump swore his oath of office and completed an extraordinary return to power, many historians, scholars and experts say his presidency has pushed American democracy to the brink – or beyond it.\n",
      "In the first year of Trump’s second term, the democratically elected US president has moved with startling speed to consolidate authority: dismantling federal agencies, purging the civil service, firing independent watchdogs, sidelining Congress, challenging judicial rulings, deploying federal force in blue cities, stifling dissent, persecuting political enemies, targeting immigrants, scapegoating marginalized groups, ordering the capture of a foreign leader, leveraging the presidency for profit, trampling academic freedom and escalating attacks on the news media.\n",
      "The scale and velocity of what he has been able to accomplish in just a year have stunned even longtime observers of authoritarian regimes, pushing the debate among academics and Americans from whether the world’s oldest continuous democracy is backsliding to whether it can still faithfully claim that distinction.\n",
      "“In 2025, the United States ceased to be a full democracy in the way that Canada, Germany or even Argentina are democracies,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, the prominent Harvard political scientists and authors of How Democracies Die, and the University of Toronto professor Lucan Way, wrote in Foreign Affairs last month. They argued that the US under Trump had “descended into competitive authoritarianism”, a system in which elections are held but the ruling party abuses power to stifle dissent and tilt the playing field in its favor.\n",
      "There is no universally accepted definition of democracy. Some argue the US is a “flawed” or “illiberal” democracy, or a democracy facing substantial “autocratization” – a process that began long before Trump came to power a decade ago but which his presidency has rapidly accelerated. Still, others believe the concerns are overblown, or reflect an intense partisan dislike of the current president.\n",
      "Since Trump’s first term, scholars have warned that it can happen here. But many now say this moment is different – not only because Trump’s approach is more methodical and his desire for vengeance more pronounced, but because he now faces far fewer internal constraints.\n",
      "The president’s Republican critics have mostly been driven from public office and those who remain say they fear retaliation for speaking out. Trump has repeatedly circumvented the GOP-controlled Congress, on spending, tariffs and war powers. And the US’s European allies are scrambling to respond to Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland, by force if necessary. In an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Trump declared that the only constraint on his presidential power was “my own morality”.\n",
      "Quantitive assessments of the country’s democratic health point are bleak.\n",
      "Ratings of US democracy by scholars – and Americans overall – dropped “significantly” after Trump took office last year, according to data from Bright Line Watch, a non-partisan democracy-monitoring initiative that surveys political scientists and the public on potential threats and erosions. In its September survey, experts rated US democracy 54 on a 100-point scale, placing the country closer to illiberal or hybrid regimes than to the full democracies of G7 peers such as Canada or the United Kingdom.\n",
      "An assessment by the Century Foundation’s new democracy indexing project found that the US had recorded a staggering 28% “collapse” in democratic health over the past year – from 79/100 in 2024 to 57/100 in 2025, the kind of sudden decline more typically associated with coup or other major shock.\n",
      "Nate Schenkkan, the report’s lead author and a former research director at Freedom House, hoped to help Americans distinguish between the “push-pull” of partisan politics and the “authoritarian behavior” of the current administration.\n",
      "“When a major change happens in a political system, it’s very unevenly distributed,” Schenkkan said. “Certain people will feel it first. Certain communities will feel it harder and faster. And it is really important to recognize that just because it hasn’t come to you doesn’t mean that it won’t.”\n",
      "The sense of alarm is especially acute among those who witnessed democratic backsliding elsewhere. Last year, a network of former intelligence and national security professionals applied the same analytical methods they once used to assess the fragility of democracies abroad to the United States. In October, they published an intelligence-style report, concluding with “moderate to high confidence” that the country was “on a trajectory” toward authoritarian rule.\n",
      "The White House has repeatedly rejected claims that the president’s actions amount to authoritarianism, dismissing such criticism as “deeply unserious” and rooted in what the president calls “Trump derangement syndrome”. When pressed, the president has said he was handed a broad mandate to restore “law and order”, secure elections and dismantle what he has described as a corrupt federal bureaucracy.\n",
      "“Here’s the reality: President Trump was resoundingly re-elected by the American people based on his America First agenda,” White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, said in a statement. “Now, he’s delivering on all his campaign promises – that’s democracy in action.”\n",
      "Not all scholars agree that American democracy is in imminent peril. Some are wary that democracy indices rely too heavily on subjective indicators, which can amplify pessimism and media alarm over objective markers of democratic breakdown.\n",
      "“I think we should be a little cautious – not that the experts are necessarily wrong,” said Andrew Little, a political scientist at UC Berkeley, whose research has found that scholars who rate democratic threats tend toward pessimism. He favors a “minimalist” approach to measuring the health of a democracy: “Is the country having free elections, and are people following the results of those elections?”\n",
      "Especially worrying for scholars of contemporary authoritarianism is the president’s close relationship with tech billionaires, or the so-called “broligarchy”, many of whom donated to and were front and center at his inauguration ceremony a year ago. At the start of his presidency, Trump appointed the Tesla and SpaceX head, Elon Musk, to lead the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge.\n",
      "Oligarchs typically exert influence from the outside, said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a prominent historian and author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present. But with Doge, the “oligarch of oligarchs was allowed to come inside the government and was basically given the key to access our treasury, the payment systems and data systems of a superpower”, she said. “So we are innovating the autocratic playbook.”\n",
      "While at the White House, Musk took a chainsaw to the federal government, firing thousands of workers in sweeping, indiscriminate cuts that were quickly challenged in court. Estimates suggest more than 300,000 federal workers left in the Trump-era exodus, draining the government of top scientists, researchers and analysts.\n",
      "Traditionally autocratic regimes expand social services for supporters as a way to buy loyalty, while stripping away their political rights, Ben-Ghiat said: “That’s how they get so many people to go along and look the other way.” But Trump, she said, has diverged from that model: rather than shoring up the social safety net, his administration, abetted by congressional Republicans, has moved to “kneecap” public health and social programs, including childcare benefits – cuts Democrats plan to foreground in this year’s midterm elections.\n",
      "Even the most grim assessments stress that democratic decline is not irreversible – and warn that fatalism itself can accelerate backsliding.\n",
      "“History suggests that it is possible to recover from democratic erosion – but far from a guarantee,” Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College and a co-director of Bright Line Watch, said by email.\n",
      "Staying engaged, protesting, voting and supporting Republicans who dissent were all ways to contest Trump’s power, he said, adding: “The survival of democracy depends on people believing in its continued viability and fighting to defend it.”\n",
      "Last year, millions joined No Kings rallies to denounce a president they say has wielded power like a monarch.\n",
      "At the ballot box, Democrats won a series of victories in the 2025 off-year elections, and are well positioned to retake the House – and possibly the Senate – in the 2026 midterms. Trump, meanwhile, remains unpopular nationally – a vulnerability for his party heading into this year’s elections. A CNN poll found that a majority of Americans believe Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country, and 58% call his first year a failure.\n",
      "Trump’s fragile political standing is one indication that the administration’s narrative is increasingly at “odds with what people see – their lived experience”, Ben-Ghiat said. The more that gap widens, she said, “the more people will wake up”.\n",
      "She pointed to Minneapolis, where Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act as a response to protests against the killing of a 37-year-old US citizen by a federal immigration officer. Instead of retreating, hundreds of Minnesotans registered for training to become “observers” of enforcement activity.\n",
      "In the courts, Trump’s executive actions have been met with robust legal resistance. The ACLU, which has filed over 200 legal challenges against the Trump administration in the past year, touted a nearly 65% success rate in “defeating, delaying, or diluting federal policies”.\n",
      "“We judge the moment we’re in not by examining the president’s actions alone, but by evaluating the system’s response to those provocations as well,” Ben Wizner, deputy legal director at the ACLU, said.\n",
      "Despite the supreme court’s conservative supermajority – cemented by Trump in his first term – and the president’s sustained campaign to delegitimize judges, Wizner retained a measured optimism: “I am confident that we will emerge from this latest stress test to our democracy with our fundamental rights intact.”\n",
      "Looking ahead, many scholars predict Trump’s assault on democratic norms and the rule of law is likely to worsen in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms – an erosion that could become entrenched if Democrats fail to secure a check on his presidency by winning back a chamber of Congress.\n",
      "The most recent Bright Line survey found experts increasingly worried about political violence following the assassination of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Concerns also focused on the administration’s aggressive response to peaceful protest, the weaponization of government agencies to punish political opponents, and the president’s unprecedented push to gerrymander congressional districts in Republican states.\n",
      "Elsewhere, Democrats and political observers have raised fears that Trump could dispatch the national guard to polling places as an intimidation tactic, while others worry about the expansion of ICE operations in Democratic-run cities.\n",
      "In an interview with Reuters last week, Trump mused that he had accomplished so much in 2025, “we shouldn’t even have an election” in 2026. The White House said he was “simply joking”. Though the federal government cannot unilaterally cancel the midterms, Trump has already taken extraordinary steps to try to change how elections are conducted.\n",
      "“Autocrats try to convince us that we’re hopeless and helpless. That they’re always going to be there, and there’s no point in resisting,” Ben-Ghiat said. But political dissidents of repressive regimes know better, she said, recalling a conversation with Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal colony.\n",
      "She had asked Navalnaya how she viewed the US after Trump’s return to power. “You still have elections,” she replied. “And you can use them.” \n",

      "BRUSSELS (AP) — European Union lawmakers on Wednesday voted to hold up ratification of a major free trade agreement with the Mercosur group of South American countries over concerns about the legality of the deal.\n",
      "In a vote in Strasbourg, France, lawmakers narrowly approved sending the EU-Mercosur agreement to Europe’s top court to rule on whether it is in line with the bloc’s treaties. The result was 334 votes in favor to 324 against, with 11 abstentions.\n",

      "The long sought-after free trade agreement was signed into effect on Saturday. Twenty-five years in the making, it aimed to strengthen commercial ties in the face of rising protectionism and trade tensions around the world.\n",
      "The deal was seen as a central priority of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who shepherded it through a key vote on Jan. 9 among the EU’s 27 leaders. “The more trading partners we have world-wide, the more independent we are,” von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, pointing to Mercosur and another trade deal in the works with India.\n",
      "Supported by South America’s cattle-raising countries and European industrial interests, the accord is aimed at gradually eliminating more than 90% of tariffs on goods ranging from Argentine beef to German cars, creating one of the world’s largest free trade zones and making shopping cheaper for more than 700 million consumers.\n",
      "France, Europe’s major agricultural producer, wanted stronger protections for farmers and has sought to delay the pact. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot welcomed the parliament’s vote, saying in a social media post that the assembly “expressed itself in line with the position that we have defended. France takes responsibility for saying no when it has to, and history often proves it right. The fight continues.”\n",
      "The European Commission said that it “strongly regrets” the parliament’s decision.\n",
      "However, the EU’s powerful executive branch can provisionally apply the deal until then. EU leaders are expected to discuss the way ahead at an emergency summit focused on transatlantic relations on Thursday.\n",
      "In a post on social media, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz described the EU parliament’s decision as “regrettable.”\n",
      "“It misjudges the geopolitical situation. We are convinced of the legality of the agreement. No further delays. The agreement must now be applied provisionally,” Merz wrote.\n",
      "Bernd Lange, head of the parliament’s committee on trade, said the vote was “absolutely irresponsible” and “very harmful for our economic interests.”\n",
      "Opponents should simply vote against ratification “instead of using delaying tactics under the guise of legal review,” he wrote on X.\n",
      "Ratification is considered all but guaranteed in South America, where the agreement has broad support.\n",
      "Mercosur consists of the region’s two biggest economies, Argentina and Brazil, as well as Paraguay and Uruguay. Bolivia, the bloc’s newest member, is not included the trade deal, but could join in the coming years. Venezuela has been suspended from the bloc and is not included in the agreement.\n",

      "13. Greenland’s strategic position in seven maps: Why Trump wants the island\n",
      "   Published: 2026-01-21T13:56:32+00:00\n",

      "   Fulltext: \n",
      "\n",
      "Greenland’s strategic position in seven maps: Why Trump wants the island\n",
      "The world’s largest island sits in the Arctic Circle and is strategically and economically valuable.\n",
      "US President Donald Trump is in Davos, Switzerland, to attend the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum (WEF), where the issue of Greenland will be front and centre.\n",
      "Trump’s long-running fixation on acquiring Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, has escalated into a transatlantic imbroglio, with threats of sweeping new tariffs and even taking Greenland by military force rattling stock markets.\n",
      "Speaking at a White House media briefing on Tuesday to mark one year since his second-term inauguration, he said Greenland was “imperative for national and world security”.\n",
      "He warned the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland that they will face 10 percent tariffs on all goods from February 1, rising to 25 percent by June, unless they back his proposed takeover of the Danish autonomous territory. It comes as European leaders meeting in Davos warn the dispute risks a trade war and a rupture in the NATO alliance.\n",
      "Where is Greenland?\n",
      "Greenland is the world’s largest island, located mostly within the Arctic Circle between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Geographically, it is part of North America, lying northeast of Canada and west of Iceland, but politically it is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.\n",
      "Approximately 80 percent of Greenland is covered by the Greenland ice sheet, the second-largest body of ice on Earth. Because the interior is largely uninhabitable, most of Greenland’s population lives along the coastline. The capital city, Nuuk, located on the southwest coast, is Greenland’s largest city, home to about one-third of the island’s roughly 56,000 residents.\n",
      "Countries in the Arctic Circle\n",
      "The Arctic Circle is an imaginary line at 66.5 degrees north that includes the North Pole, the northernmost point on Earth.\n",
      "Eight countries, including Canada, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States, have land lying within this region.\n",
      "Some Arctic countries are closer to each other than many people realise.\n",
      "Greenland’s closest neighbour is Canada, and at its narrowest point, between the Nares Strait, the two countries are only 26km (16 miles) apart. Canada and Greenland also technically share a land border, having settled a decades-long dispute over Hans Island, a small rock in the strait, by dividing it in half.\n",
      "Russia and the US are also neighbours, with Alaska and Russia separated by the Bering Strait, which is about 85km (53 miles) at its narrowest point – a distance similar to that between New York City and New Jersey.\n",
      "In fact, when you count the Diomede Islands located within the Bering Strait, Russia and the United States are less than 4km (2.4 miles) apart. These small, rocky islands consist of Big Diomede, which belongs to Russia and hosts a weather station, and Little Diomede, part of Alaska. The islands are separated by the International Date Line, creating a 21-hour time difference and marking the boundary between North America and Asia.\n",
      "How big is Greenland?\n",
      "On some map projections, which enlarge landmasses near the poles, Greenland appears much bigger than it really is.\n",
      "In reality, the Arctic island covers 2.17 million square kilometres (836,330 square miles), making it roughly three times the size of the US state of Texas, or about the same size as Saudi Arabia, Mexico or the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n",
      "Arctic shipping routes\n",
      "Most of the Arctic is divided into exclusive economic zones (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles (370km) from the territorial waters of states and where they have jurisdiction over natural resources.\n",
      "According to data from Arctic Ship Traffic Data, the number of ships operating in the Arctic has increased 37 percent between 2013 and 2023, driven by melting ice and expanding economic opportunities in the region.\n",
      "There are three main shipping routes in the Arctic, connecting the Atlantic and Pacific:\n",
      "- The Northern Sea Route (NSR)/Northeast Passage runs along the Arctic coast of Russia and could cut maritime travel between East Asia and Western Europe by 10-15 days compared with travelling via the Suez Canal. In Soviet Russia, the route was used for military supplies and extraction of resources in the Arctic. Now Russia uses it to transport liquified natural gas (LNG).\n",
      "- The Northwest Passage (NWP) crosses Canada’s Arctic Ocean and could cut maritime vessel journeys between East Asia and Europe by 10 days compared with vessels travelling via the Panama Canal.\n",
      "- The Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) goes from the centre of the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean and is a direct route via the North Pole. While this route avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states, it is rarely used due to the presence of permanent sea ice. Due to melting ice caps, it is predicted that this sea route may be fully open to vessels by the 2050s, potentially even sooner with high-strength icebreakers.\n",
      "What is the military presence in the Arctic?\n",
      "Greenland has one major permanent US base, the Pituffik Space Base, and several smaller Danish military facilities.\n",
      "Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is located in the northwest corner of the island. It supports missile warning, missile defence and space surveillance missions and satellite command and control. It is strategically positioned to counter Russian activities in the Arctic.\n",
      "About 650 personnel are stationed at the base, including US Air Force and Space Force members, as well as Canadian, Danish and Greenlandic civilian contractors. Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US is permitted to establish and maintain military facilities in Greenland as part of mutual defence within the NATO framework.\n",
      "The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a US-Canadian joint military organisation, also operates systems from Pituffik in the form of a Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) for the organisation’s space surveillance.\n",
      "In Alaska, NORAD controls the Clear Space Force Station, equipped with missile warning, defence and space awareness capabilities. The US also implements forward operating locations – temporary military airfields and radar stations – in Alaska, which are used to extend US defence and response.\n",
      "Denmark manages the defence of Greenland through the Joint Arctic Command (JAC) with its headquarters in the capital, Nuuk. The base’s main tasks are surveillance and search and rescue operations, and the “assertion of sovereignty and military defence of Greenland and the Faroe Islands”, according to Danish Defence.\n",
      "According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the Northern Sea route is central to Russia’s security posture in the Arctic. Control of the route sits with Rosatom, giving Moscow the ability to restrict foreign military traffic without direct government approval. In the eastern Arctic, access through the Bering Strait has pushed Russia to expand radar coverage, search and rescue capacity and airfields, including the Sopka-2 radar installations on Wrangel Island and Cape Schmidt.\n",
      "In the central Arctic, Russia has hardened its military footprint. Bastion-P and Pantsir-S1 systems – mobile defence systems – are deployed on Novaya Zemlya and Kotelny Island, extending area-denial across air and sea approaches.\n",
      "In the western Arctic, the Northern Fleet, which oversees Russia’s second-strike capability, is based in Severomorsk. CSIS says Moscow has also reactivated dozens of Soviet-era facilities, reopening airbases, radar stations and border posts across the region.\n",
      "Chinese investments in the Arctic\n",
      "China has emerged as a key player in the Arctic, stating its desire to create a “Polar Silk Road”, similar to the Belt and Road Initiative, where new shipping routes would emerge as ice sheets recede.\n",
      "According to the Carnegie Endowment, China views the Arctic as a future transport and industrial corridor. A number of Chinese companies also have mining projects in Greenland, including for iron ore, rare earths and uranium. China also has projects focused on Arctic energy via Russia’s LNG sector.\n",
      "Chinese state-owned firms have stakes in Novatek’s LNG projects and are a major buyer of Arctic gas. The Chinese have also supplied key equipment to Russia’s Arctic LNG projects, especially after Western sanctions on Russia.\n",
      "What are Greenland’s resources?\n",
      "Greenland is rich in natural resources, including zinc, lead, gold, iron ore, rare earth elements (REEs), copper and oil.\n",
      "It is home to some of the world’s largest deposits of rare earths used in high-tech industries. These resources have attracted significant attention, including from President Trump.\n",
      "Gold pockets exist in areas like Nanortalik and South Greenland. Greenland also has deposits of diamonds in the Maniitsoq region, just north of Nuuk.\n",
      "Copper deposits are largely unexplored in Greenland, according to the Mineral Resources Authority, with areas in the northeast and central east largely untapped. Iron ore deposits are dotted around West Greenland, while nickel traces have been found around the island’s southwest coast.\n",
      "Graphite, used mostly in EV batteries and steel-making, is also reported to exist in Greenland, with exploration around Amitsoq. While zinc has been found in the north of Greenland, titanium and vanadium deposits are located in the southwest, east and south of the territory. Tungsten is also found in central east and Northeast Greenland with assessed deposits in the south and west.\n",
      "A brief history of Greenland\n",
      "The first Inuit people settled in Greenland in about 2500 BCE.\n",
      "In the 10th century, Norse explorers arrived in Greenland and established settlements. By 1721, Denmark had made Greenland a colony.\n",
      "Though a Danish territory, Greenland became self-governing in 1979 after more than two centuries under Danish control. It is one of Denmark’s two autonomous territories, with the Faroe Islands being the other.\n",
      "In 1941, during World War II, the US and Denmark agreed to allow American forces to defend Greenland. Its strategic location was vital for countering German submarines and securing shipping routes. The US maintained a military presence throughout the Cold War, using Greenland for early-warning radar and monitoring Soviet activity.\n",
      "In 2009, Greenland gained self-rule over most of its internal affairs, including control over natural resources and governance. However, Denmark still handles foreign policy, defence and funding. \n",

      "Netflix‘s 2025 earnings and operating report is in, and so are the latest management comments on its megadeal for Warner Bros., which the streamer amended to make it all-cash just ahead of the financial update. The question going into the latest set of results was whether the earnings report and executive commentary could refocus investor attention away from the big transaction, which has been a drag on the stock, onto fundamentals, and if it could do so in a positive way.\n",
      "The streaming giant’s fourth-quarter updates included news that it ended 2025 with more than 325 million global paid subscribers, up from 302 million as of the end of 2024. But the company’s financial outlook, especially for profit margins, disappointed.\n",
      "Related Stories\n",
      "In content-focused highlights, Netflix also disclosed on Tuesday that KPop Demon Hunters is its most-watched movie or show by a long shot. And in his comments, co-CEO Ted Sarandos focused on the narrative of new competitive threats for Netflix, citing the likes of YouTube and telling investors and regulators, set to review its $83 billion deal for Warner Bros., that “Instagram is coming next.”\n",
      "In early Wednesday trading, Netflix shares hit a new 52-week low of $81.93, below the previous $82.12 low set in April, before more recently trading down 5.1 percent at $82.84.\n",
      "Here’s what Wall Street analysts make of Netflix’s latest results, The Hollywood Reporter‘s snapshot of reactions is below:\n",
      "Analyst: Jeff Wlodarczak, Pivotal Research Group\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: hold, $95, down $10\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Netflix disclosed that it had reached a subscriber level (325 million) in the fourth quarter that was about 10 million lower than our forecast,” the former Netflix bull, who recently turned more bearish, wrote, concluding that the company’s latest results were “driven more by price increases than subscriber growth.” The consequence: “Post-results we tweaked our subscriber forecasts materially lower, offset partially by higher forecast average revenue per user (ARPU),” which pushed his stock price target down from $105.\n",
      "Engagement has been a key focus for Wall Street in a competitive landscape, and Wlodarczak also has some worries on that front. “While engagement rose slightly, we are increasingly concerned that especially GenZ is less interested in long-form content as their time migrates to free social media platforms, which we believe will show up in slower subscriber and ARPU growth. This is exacerbated by the increasing popularity of FAST platforms, as inflation has put pressure on low-income households in particular.”\n",
      "In December, the Pivotal analyst had downgraded Netflix shares, arguing that the Warner Bros. deal felt like an admission of the competitive power of the likes of YouTube and TikTok. So what’s his latest take on the mega-merger? “We do not account for the WBD deal as we expect the price to move higher but we would expect the deal to lead to higher subscriber/ARPU forecasts, partly by eliminating a major potential competitor for Netflix [in] Paramount, and we expect the deal will be approved by regulators but it will require Netflix to sell the HBO distribution assets (Comcast being the most likely candidate to sell to) with a medium-term content rights deal attached to the asset,” Wlodarczak suggested. “This will be offset materially by the very expensive price Netflix will be paying for these assets, and net-net we would not expect a material difference in our target price post the close of this deal.”\n",
      "Analyst: Laurent Yoon, Bernstein\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: outperform, $115, down $10\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Solid 2025 overshadowed by disappointing 2026 margin guide,” the expert summarized in the headline of his report, which fit well into the broader Wall Street chorus.\n",
      "He broke down the issue in more detail. “Management is guiding to a solid 12-14 percent revenue growth, implying a … price increase, further supported by healthy subscriber growth and a doubling of advertising revenue to $3 billion in 2026,” Yoon explained. “Depending on the timing and magnitude of the price hike and advertising ramp, we believe 14 percent-plus revenue growth remains achievable in 2026. And given Netflix’s track record of exceeding top-line guidance in recent years, we remain constructive its revenue trajectory.” That said, its guidance for a 31.5 percent margin in 2026 only implies a change from 30.5 percent despite the big revenue jump, he highlighted.\n",
      "“What [stock] multiple do you assign a company growing [revenue] at low double-digits with flat margins and about to be levered up” in the Warner Bros. deal, Yoon summarized the challenge for Wall Street, predicting the firm’s margin projections would increase over time. His takeaway was to lower his earnings forecasts, “driven mostly by higher content costs per management’s guidance,” and price target, while sticking to his stock rating. “Near-term sentiment and volatility are likely to persist, driven by softer-than-expected margin guidance and the WBD deal overhang,” he concluded. “That said, this setup also creates meaningful upside as the pursuit of WBD becomes more certain and margin guidance is revised upward into the second half.”\n",
      "Analyst: Brian Pitz, BMO Capital Markets\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: outperform, $135, down $8\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Trying to Be Superman, But Not Immune to Kryptonite” was the headline of the expert’s Wednesday report. “Netflix delivered solid fourth-quarter results,” he explained. “The initial 2026 [financial guidance] was mixed,” especially for operating margins, but in a positive, “importantly, Netflix expects its advertising business to roughly double in 2026 to $3 billion as ad revenue scales to 6 percent of Netflix’s 2026 revenue.”\n",
      "While all this led Pitz to reduce his stock price target, he reiterated his “outperform” rating, concluding that the company “remains the best-positioned player in streaming to gain share of linear TV budgets that continue to shift online.”\n",
      "But the BMO expert expects deal noise to get more attention than operating trends for at least a while, warning: “[The] WBD acquisition remains [the] near-term focus.”\n",
      "Analyst: Ralph Schackart, William Blair\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: outperform, no price target\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Solid quarter but guidance a bit light,” his highlights from the results echoed those of some peers. “Shifting focus to 2026 initiatives and close of Warner Bros. acquisition.”\n",
      "Schackart summarized his read on the company’s engagement trends this way: “In the second half of 2025, view hours increased 2 percent (up from 1 percent growth in the first half), driven by a 9 percent increase in branded original content viewing hours from titles like the final season of Stranger Things and The Reckoning, Sean Combs’ documentary. However, overall engagement trends were impacted by a year-over-year decline in non-branded content viewing hours as a result of the WGA strike elevating licensing costs of second-run content in most regions from 2023 through 2024.”\n",
      "In terms of the financial outlook, the expert noted that first-quarter revenue and margin guidance came in below Wall Street expectations. “Shares were down about 4.5 percent in the after market, likely due to the light guidance versus the Street,” the analyst concluded. “While the company provided a bit more detail on its strategy of the Warner Bros. acquisition in the shareholder letter and on the call, we believe the stock will likely remain range-bound until the outcome of the deal is finalized. Even though the overall fundamentals of the business remain solid, that will likely take a back seat to the battle to acquire Warner Bros., in our view. However, we believe the stock is set up to outperform after the outcome of the Warner Bros. potential acquisition.”\n",
      "Analyst: John Blackledge, TD Cowen\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: buy, $112, down $3\n",
      "Key takeaways: Blackledge also emphasized that revenue and operating income guidance fell below analysts’ projections. However, “operating income growth is set to improve in the second half of 2026, per management, as content amortization growth decelerates,” he noted.\n",
      "He also lauded positive engagement outlook commentary as the streamer expects to “benefit from a strong content slate, including returning hits Bridgerton (season 4) and The Night Agent (season 3),” the TD Cowen analyst wrote.\n",
      "Of course, he also had takeaways on the Warner Bros. deal. “Netflix management is confident they can secure regulatory approval, citing TV competition from YouTube, Amazon, Apple, and Instagram,” the analyst said. “Management highlighted Warner Bros’ ‘complementary’ theatrical business, TV studio, and HBO Max, while noting potential for more flexible sub options as a combined business.”\n",
      "Analyst: Alicia Reese, Wedbush\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: outperfrom, $115\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Long-term outweighs near-term drag,” Reese summarized here sentiment in the headline of her Wednesday report. “Shares are again under pressure after a second underwhelming quarter, as investors have become accustomed to phenomenal results,” she explained. “Still, we think Netflix is positioning for substantial growth in global advertising, and that should not be overlooked.”\n",
      "Patience will be the key, she advised investors. “Ad revenue should at least double to $3 billion in 2026, with significant opportunities remaining in 2027 and beyond, particularly if Netflix can close the WB deal next year,” she wrote. “That said, we expect volatility in shares until the April shareholder vote and Netflix’s first-quarter earnings results. A lengthy regulatory process notwithstanding, we expect less overhang after the shareholder vote. Plus, Netflix’s results should improve throughout the year, and shares should see a notable lift, particularly in the back half of the year when advertising revenue and price increases outpace increased content spend.”\n",
      "Reese also weighed in on the debate about competitive risks for the streaming giant, sharing: “As Netflix continues to hone its content strategy, adding more global content, live events, podcasts, and evolving its release strategy to maximize buzz, we expect viewership to continue to rise over the next two years.”\n",
      "Analyst: Michael Morris, Guggenheim\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: buy, $130, down $15\n",
      "Key takeaways: Morris was among the Wall Street experts cutting their stock price target on the streamer on Wednesday amid reduced earnings estimates, with the target in his case from $145 to $130. “Netflix delivered top-and-bottom line beats slightly ahead of Street fourth-quarter forecasts, though engagement trend and 2026 profit guidance temper enthusiasm,” he explained.\n",
      "He also touched on the company’s bi-annual engagement report. It “exhibited a second-half 2025 viewership increase of 2.2 percent (versus 1.3 percent in the first half 2025), which we expect will continue to fuel questions around the importance of the WBD acquisition and the risk to long-term growth expectations should the company’s bid be unsuccessful,” Morris shared.\n",
      "So what’s ahead for Netflix? More deal clouds overhanging the stock, according to the expert. Wrote Morris: “We expect the path to conclusion on the WBD bid will remain a primary sentiment driver and likely share appreciation limiter over the next three months.”\n",
      "Analyst: Robert Fishman, MoffettNathanson\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: buy, $115, down $25\n",
      "Key takeaways: Stranger Things is finished, but the analyst diagnosed the comeback of a familiar Netflix stock issue, highlighting in the headline of his report: “The Old Bull & Bear Debate Returns.” “The growing bear case for Netflix, even ahead of the initial WBD bidding war, revolved around whether slowing engagement would lead to a faster deceleration in revenue growth,” he wrote. “With last year’s pullback in subscriber disclosure and a continued lack of advertising revenue detail, investors were left debating whether the engagement monetization story would be enough to sustain double-digit total company revenue growth and … margin expansion in the out years.” The surprise Warner Bros. only deepened the debate. Does it mean that Netflix’s core growth is “slowing even faster and a deal of this size is a necessary means to solve its long-term engagement problem and/or reinvigorate profits,” the expert explained.\n",
      "The earnings update didn’t provide a clear answer, leaving investors to pick what they wanted to focus on, Fishman suggested. On a positive note, advertising revenue is expected to keep growing strongly, and more price increases are expected. On the downside, margins aren’t growing much, and engagement trends are mixed.\n",
      "“Despite returning to the familiar old debate over subscriber versus pricing growth plus how quickly advertising can reach at least 10 percent of total revenues (we now think by 2029), we are left to acknowledge Netflix’s stock price should have a harder time rebounding as long as the ongoing WBD potential bidding war continues,” Fishman concluded, cutting his forecasts and stock price target, but remaining positive on the stock’s long-term outlook: “After the recent pullback, we think Netflix stock price reflects an attractive entry point for investors willing to focus on the growth in the core businesses as well as trust that the company will remain disciplined in its pursuit of Warner Bros.”\n",
      "Analyst: Peter Supino, Wolfe Research\n",
      "Stock rating and price target: outperform, $95, down $26\n",
      "Key takeaways: “Expense guidance fueled concerns inflamed by the Warner bid,” he highlighted in his summary of takeaways from the company’s latest earnings report and guidance. “The cost of growth was already of deep concern to investors.”\n",
      "But Supino does like the investment. “Netflix’s decisions to press its scale advantages by acquiring Warner and accelerating content & ad tech spending should reinforce Netflix’s long-term growth and category leadership,” he wrote. “With a less than 10 percent share of global TV viewing and less than 15 percent TV revenue share in the U.S., Netflix can sustain double digit percentage growth for another decade.”\n",
      "That said, he urged shareholders not to hope for overnight gains. “The overhang of the Warner merger implies that investors should prepare to be patient,” the analyst emphasized. “Management has put a lot on investors recently – quoting a VIP from Squid Game (quoting an 8th century Chinese poet): ‘Good rain knows the best time to fall’.”\n",

      "Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, stood at 3.2% in December, unchanged from November, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.\n",

      "\"Airfares also contributed to the increase with prices rising more than a year ago, likely because of the timing of return flights over the Christmas and New Year period. Rising food costs, particularly for bread and cereals, were also an upward driver,\" he added.\n",
      "These increases were partially offset by a fall in rents inflation and lower prices for a range of recreational and cultural purchases, the ONS noted.\n",
      "Pound sterling was largely flat against the dollar following the data, at $1.3231.\n",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves told CNBC Wednesday that the Bank of England had expected inflation to rise slightly before it's expected to cool into spring and summer, toward the central bank's 2% target.\n",

      "\"A small monthly rise in prices is unlikely to concern policymakers at the Bank of England in the short-term, especially as pay growth continues on a downwards trajectory,\" Scott Gardner, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Personal Investing, said in emailed comments Wednesday.\n",
      "\"If pay growth continues to fall and this is reflected in inflation data, it could place pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates faster than expected.

      "January has become a nightmare for millions of Windows users, as Microsoft’s latest January update creates a surprising raft of issues. We have seen multiple emergency updates. But serious problems remain. And there’s no firm timeline on fixes.\n",
      "“This year’s first mandatory Windows 11 update is a mess,” Windows Latest warns. Users keep reaching out “to share their nightmare experience,.” For those unaware, \"this update is a mandatory security patch, so it’s going to attempt installation whether you like it or not.” And that makes failures unavoidable.\n",
      "Three of the issues have been acknowledged by Microsoft. The Classic Outlook freezing bug, the Remote Desktop Bug, and the failure to shutdown bug. “But it doesn’t look like there were only three issues that needed Microsoft’s attention.”\n",
      "Microsoft is looking into an issue with desktop.ini that likely means it will be fixed soon. But there’s also a new sleep state issue that is garnering increasing user complaints. This preserves battery and power, but the issue is PCs are not falling asleep as planned.\n",
      "Windows Latest says “there’s a regression bug in Windows 11 25H2 on the desktop S3 sleep path. Even with hybrid sleep and wake timers disabled, the system-level Maintenance Activator (SystemEventsBroker) does not properly clear the maintenance wake context after the first wake, causing the second sleep to wake immediately.”\n",
      "All users are advised to watch for additional emergency out-of-band updates to fix outstanding issues. Some may await February’s updates, which means installing it as soon as available. Not great, but unfortunately not that unusual.\n",
      "“We’re monitoring reports of other problems in the January 2026 update,” Windows Latest says, “including a bug where the keyboard and mouse do not work correctly. The list of reported issues keeps growing, which is concerning, as Windows 11 had more than 20 major problems in 2025 with just 12 security updates.” \n",

      "I used Claude Code to vibe code a Mac app in 8 hours, but it was more work than magic\n",
      "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n",
      "ZDNET's key takeaways\n",
      "- Vibe coding trades creativity for coordination and oversight.\n",
      "- Performance and UI issues still demand human judgment.\n",
      "- AI shines when developers relentlessly lead, test, and correct.\n",
      "Over all my years in the software business, I've built software using two fundamental techniques. The first technique was writing code myself, line-by-line. I enjoy that practice, though it can be incredibly time-consuming. If you hit a flow state, you can really groove on the process.\n",
      "The second technique was managing other coders. This was usually a force multiplier, because those developers were often better and faster at line-by-line coding than I was. I could manage a few developers, moving projects along faster.\n",
      "But I didn't enjoy that practice as much. There was never a flow state. It was more like a constant level of planning, convincing, cajoling, correcting, and a bit of chaos. People are going to people, and if you're a manager, that's what you get.\n",
      "Also: 10 things I wish I knew before trusting Claude Code to build my iPhone app\n",
      "There is no flow state that comes from building a Mac app using AI with Claude Code. If you've ever managed programmers, you know what using Claude Code feels like. It is an enormous force multiplier, but you're going to spend most of your time cajoling and correcting, and some of your time trying to chart your way out of AI-generated chaos.\n",
      "As with managing human programmers, you're going to be much more successful with Claude Code if you know how to code and you understand the underlying technology. That way, you can guide the AI on architectural and design decisions as well as simply defining features.\n",
      "My ZDNET colleague Tiernan Ray recently tried his hand at vibe coding. He describes himself as a \"newbie, with limited programming knowledge.\" His conclusion: \"I will say that using these tools gave me a greater appreciation for programmers.\"\n",
      "Also: I tried vibe coding an app as a beginner - here's what Cursor and Replit taught me\n",
      "I'm telling you this to set expectations. I've been programming since the time of wooden ships and iron programmers. The benefits I, and by extension any experienced developer, will get from a tool like Claude Code may be available to intrepid hungry-to-learn non-programmers as well. But don't expect to wave a magic wand and get an app suitable for market just because you're using an AI.\n",
      "With that, let's dive into my Mac project.\n",
      "Starting with my iPhone app\n",
      "I started with the iPhone app I previously built using Claude Code. The purpose of this app is to manage 3D printing filament spools dynamically. I have 120 spools that live on four storage racks of five shelves each. The spools are constantly moved between the racks and eight 3D printers, five of which can use four spools at once, one which can use eight spools, and two which are limited to just one spool each.\n",
      "The iPhone app uses NFC tags to make it super easy to track the movement of these spools and uses the built-in camera to grab images of each spool for reference. I've been using this app daily for about two months now, and it's a huge win for my workflow.\n",
      "Also: Vibe coding feels magical, but it can sink your business fast - here's how\n",
      "But now, I want to make it work on the Mac. I also want to make it work on my Apple Watch, but that's a story for a different article.\n",
      "I initiate most of my print jobs over the network from my Mac, so being able to clearly see what materials and colors I have available, and what's already been allocated, can prove helpful. I could use my phone, of course. But I'd like to be able to just open a Mac application on my desktop and see what I have in inventory.\n",
      "The iPhone app is built using Swift and SwiftUI in Apple's Xcode development environment. I use Claude Code in the terminal, where it works with Xcode to write the code.\n",
      "Porting to the Mac\n",
      "There is a lot of crossover between the Mac's UI and the iPhone UI, particularly when using Swift. Fortunately, porting to the Mac did not require an entire rewrite. But it did require a lot of rework.\n",
      "First, there was the question of the Mac's limitations. My Mac Studio doesn't have a camera, and the Mac doesn't support NFC scanning. So while I wanted to retain the NFC and photo data gathered by the iPhone app, the Mac isn't able to scan or manage it.\n",
      "I also wanted the Mac to sync instantly and completely with the iPhone app. Whatever spool data existed on the iPhone should be visible from the Mac. Fortunately, Apple has built a fairly extensive library for sharing data via iCloud.\n",
      "Also: What is AI vibe coding? It's all the rage but it's not for everyone - here's why\n",
      "I knew I was going to want to share my data when I started the iPhone app, so I built the iCloud architecture into the iPhone app from the beginning. When I started with the Mac app, it was just a matter of tapping into that data and bringing it down to the computer as well as the phone.\n",
      "That was my starting point. I made sure to make a full backup of the app directory. I also checked everything into GitHub for source control and management.\n",
      "Then I fired up Claude Code, told it I wanted it to branch my local Git repo, and explained I wanted to build a Mac app based on the work done on the iPhone app. As part of that first prompt, I explained that NFC and camera features didn't need to be ported, but the iCloud architecture would be.\n",
      "Ten minutes later, I had a Mac app. It was crap. It looked terrible. Every time the spool list came up, it took forever to fill in. But getting from nothing to first run in ten minutes took about ten days less than it would have taken me had I done it line-by-line.\n",
      "Alternating between functionality and UI\n",
      "It took a few rounds of running Xcode's build tool, waiting for its inevitable errors and warnings, sharing those errors and warnings with Claude, and repeating. But after a while, the app was functional, although nothing like what I wanted to eventually end up with.\n",
      "One area that Claude had some initial difficulty with was reconciling that the Mac has windows that resize. As such, the UI elements have to scale and resize accordingly. This is where building up Claude's knowledge base became enormously important.\n",
      "Also: 10 professional developers on vibe coding's true promise and peril\n",
      "As I did with the iPhone app, I instructed Claude Code to build in notes and status updates about everything it worked on, as well as lessons we learned. So once Claude finally understood that windows resize, that became a rule embedded in the project instructions.\n",
      "On the iPhone, you transition from screen to screen, all in a vertical orientation. But on the Mac, I chose to make a three-pane screen. The left pane contains the main option buttons, the middle pane contains the list of spools, and the rightmost pane contains the spool data.\n",
      "It didn't take too long to get that working, but it took a large number of rounds of back-and-forth prompts to get it to look nice. There isn't any one particularly standout prompt I can share with you, but I can tell you that I described what I wanted to see, had it move and rearrange items, and add styling to sections of the display. I did that with Claude a lot.\n",
      "Also: I let Anthropic's Claude Cowork loose on my files, and it was both brilliant and scary\n",
      "Unfortunately, adding the three-pane display to the Mac implementation somehow broke the iPhone app. Here's where being a programmer helps, because I finally figured out that Claude was probably trying to share screens across apps. When I explicitly told it to create new interface screens for the Mac and then repair the iPhone ones, things worked much better.\n",
      "Architecturally, we had to deal with speed issues. The spool list was slow because it loaded full-resolution photos for every row. The fix was a thumbnail caching system that creates small 128-pixel versions of photos, stores them on disk, and generates them in the background so the list scrolls smoothly even with hundreds of spools.\n",
      "We also had to explore how to refresh that list, reduce wait time for image creation, and add purging features.\n",
      "Managing, not coding\n",
      "At the beginning of this article, I mentioned my two modes of software creation: coding and managing. When working with Claude Code, I spent most of my time managing.\n",
      "In fact, the best mindset I could find was one where I treat the AI the same way I'd treat a remote human programmer. I gave it assignments. I asked questions. I asked for its opinion. I pointed out errors. I tested, tested, and tested some more. Then I tested again.\n",
      "Also: The best free AI for coding in 2025 - only 3 make the cut now\n",
      "Claude did as well in producing this project as any programmer I've assigned work to in the past. There were times when Claude was obtuse and stubborn, but my human programmers had similar moments of uncooperativeness.\n",
      "Without a doubt, managing the AI was not nearly as pleasant an experience as coding on my own. On the other hand, we created a full Mac app that does exactly what I want in about 8 hours of project time, spread over about a month of real time.\n",
      "If you're thinking about making a Mac app with Claude Code, or any AI for that matter, my recommendation is that you work slowly, add features one-by-one, and refine. Then, once the project reaches a somewhat functional state, switch 90% of your attention to testing. Don't assume that anything will be built as you have asked. Claude left out some key features and didn't implement them until I pointed them out to it.\n",
      "Also: Coding with AI? My top 5 tips for vetting its output - and staying out of trouble\n",
      "But without a doubt, the productivity benefits were huge. I have a special custom-purpose app now on my iPhone and my Mac designed specifically for my workflow. And it works. I still haven't decided if I want to turn it into a product or not, but even if I never sell it, the few hundred bucks I spent on Claude Code Max over the past three months has definitely been worth it.\n",
      "Stay tuned. My next project is moving my app to the Apple Watch.\n",
      "What about you? Have you tried building an app using AI tools like Claude Code, either as a developer or as someone still learning to code? Did it feel more like collaborating with a teammate or managing one? What worked well for you, what broke in unexpected ways, and do you see yourself trusting AI for larger projects?

      "PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — The 42nd Sundance Film Festival kicks off this week in Park City, Utah. It will be the last edition in its longtime home and the first without its founder Robert Redford, who died in September at age 89.\n",
      "But even in this time of transition and change, the festival’s main focus — the movies — remains as vibrant and fresh as ever with 90 features premiering through Feb. 1. And three of them feature pop star Charli xcx.\n",
      "“It’s a broad, eclectic and bold program,” Sundance public programming director Eugene Hernandez told The Associated Press.\n",
      "Hernandez said the lineup for the festival’s final year in Park City has a “mixture of new, exciting voices paired with some really, really great familiar faces from Sundances past that I think will create a great alchemy for this really unique edition in Utah.”\n",
      "When is Sundance?\n",
      "The festival runs from Thursday, Jan. 22 through Sunday, Feb. 1. There are 90 features premiering throughout, with screenings starting early in the morning and running through midnight. Award winners will be announced on Jan. 30.\n",
      "What celebrities are expected?\n",
      "Some big names who may make an appearance in the mountains include Natalie Portman, Ethan Hawke, Russell Crowe, Brittney Griner, Seth Rogen, O’Shea Jackson Jr., David Duchovny, Olivia Wilde, Daveed Diggs, Channing Tatum, Courtney Love, Chris Pine, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Salman Rushdie, Alexander Skarsgård, Olivia Colman, John Turturro and Catherine Zeta-Jones.\n",
      "How is Sundance honoring Robert Redford?\n",
      "Redford’s legacy will be a main spotlight at the festival, including at Friday night’s annual fundraising gala where organizers will pay tribute to the Sundance founder. Later in the festival, there will also be a screening of his first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama “Downhill Racer,” and a series of legacy screenings of restored Sundance gems from “Little Miss Sunshine” to Barbara Kopple’s documentary “American Dream.”\n",
      "What are the buzzy movies?\n",
      "Wilde directed her third feature, “The Invite,” in which she and Rogen play an unhappily married couple who host a dinner party for friends (Penélope Cruz and Edward Norton). Gregg Araki made a “sex-positive love letter to Gen Z” with “I Want Your Sex,” also starring Wilde as a provocative artist who takes an interest in a younger intern played by Cooper Hoffman. Portman, sporting platinum blond hair, leads the big ensemble cast of Cathy Yan’s art world satire “The Gallerist,” alongside Zach Galifianakis, Jenna Ortega and Zeta-Jones.\n",
      "Both “I Want Your Sex” and “The Gallerist” feature supporting turns from Charli xcx, but the pop star’s big showcase is “The Moment,” a self-referential mockumentary. Colman stars alongside Skarsgård in “Wicker,” a whimsical tale of a fisherwoman who asks a basket weaver to weave her a husband. Crowe plays the warden of a work camp in 1930s Oregon where Hawke is toiling in “The Weight.” And Gemma Chan and Tatum play parents to a child who witnesses a crime in “Josephine.”\n",
      "In the nonfiction space, “Navalny” director Daniel Roher co-directed a film about artificial intelligence. There are also documentaries about Love, the lead singer of “Hole” and widow of Kurt Cobain, and Griner, the WNBA star who was detained for nearly 10 months in Russia.\n",
      "Can you stream Sundance movies?\n",
      "Yes, but not until Jan. 29. Access to the movies premiering at Sundance doesn’t necessarily require an expensive trip to Park City anymore. The festival has fully embraced an online component for many of their films.\n",
      "What started as a necessary COVID-19 adjustment has become a vital part of the program. From Jan. 29 through Feb. 1, audiences can watch the films in competition online. Prices start at $35 for a single film ticket.\n",
      "When will the Sundance movies be in theaters?\n",
      "It depends. Some have distribution and will soon be in theaters, like “The Moment,” which A24 is releasing on Jan. 30. Others that might secure distribution deals out of the festival can take anywhere from a few weeks to over a year to hit theaters or streaming services.\n",
      "Is the festival still moving to Colorado?\n",
      "Yes, this is the final edition in Park City, Utah. Next January, the festival is relocating to a new home in Boulder, Colorado.\n",

      "24. There Are Three Distinct Kinds of Ryan Murphy Shows. His Latest Is a Winning Combination of All of Them.\n",
      "   Published: 2026-01-21T17:13:00+00:00\n",
      "   URL: https://slate.com/culture/2026/01/the-beauty-fx-show-evan-peters-bella-hadid-ryan-murphy-tv.html\n",
      "   Fulltext: \n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of a new Ryan Murphy show can sometimes feel like a threat. Which version of the outrageously prolific showrunner are we going to get? Murphy, of course, is the visionary auteur behind camp classics like Nip/Tuck, the American Horror Story franchise, Pose, and—yes—Glee. All these are shows that, even if they ultimately overstayed their welcome, were singularly unique when they first arrived on American television screens and asserted the existence of a fresh creative mind. Then there’s the Murphy who, shall we say, phones it in. It’s this Murphy—lazy and overly reliant on aesthetics in place of any real substance—who we can thank for shows like The Politician, Hollywood, and All’s Fair, a show so profoundly bad that I was almost wishing for a world in which A.I. takes over, if only so that I need never wonder how a fellow human being could subject the rest of us to such drivel.\n",
      "Thankfully, Murphy’s latest outing for FX, The Beauty, falls mostly in the former category. (His work for FX, typically home to decent-to-good TV, tends to be his strongest.) Across 11 episodes, the first three of which premiered today, the series follows a pathogen that, after escaping a laboratory, spreads via sexual infection, causing people to become outrageously good-looking. The only rather inconvenient downside appears to be that it also results in their eventual explosion—something guest star Bella Hadid discovers in the show’s opening scenes after she tears away from a Balenciaga catwalk show, goes on a bloody rampage through Paris, and finally turns into a human water balloon. It’s ridiculous, certainly, but it’s entertaining too. What other show is going to feature an assistant editor at Vogue throwing a pop star out the windows of the Condé Nast offices before spraying her guts all over Ben Platt? Sure, like many good-looking people, The Beauty thinks it’s smarter than it ultimately is, but against my better nature, I did find myself somewhat enjoying the show, with its big-budget, ritzy locations and gorgeous production design. This was thanks mainly to star Evan Peters, who evokes glimpses of his best work as a detective in HBO’s Mare of Easttown here to play Cooper Madsen, one of the FBI agents tasked with learning about this deadly virus. The show isn’t perfect, but, as Madsen tells colleague and lover Jordan Bennett (Rebecca Hall), “embracing imperfections can create something stronger and even more beautiful than before.”\n",
      "With a few exceptions (most notably 9-1-1, a fairly typical procedural drama about first responders), Murphy’s shows tend to fall in three main camps. First, there’s the dark, scary stuff he leans into in the American Horror Story and Monster franchises. Then, there’s the prestige or period work he enjoys, notable in Pose and Halston, as well as franchises like American Crime Story and Feud, which produced his two best productions, releases focusing on the trial of O.J. Simpson and the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, respectively. Finally, there’s what I’m going to call his Cuckoo Bananas collection, featuring fatuous and fanciful series like All’s Fair and Scream Queens, where being bad is kind of the point. All of these categories contain hits and misses—or in the case of Cuckoo Bananas, almost exclusively misses—but occasionally we are treated to reminders of why Murphy remains one of Hollywood’s most in-demand showrunners. The Beauty succeeds because it combines just enough elements from all three of these buckets to showcase Murphy at his best: big-name stars, lots of sex, an embrace of trash, and the occasional pretense that all this—like beauty itself—is more than skin-deep.\n",
      "Comparisons to 2024’s The Substance are unavoidable, but while it’s clear The Beauty is influenced by the Oscar-nominated Demi Moore film, its source material, a comic book by Jeremy Haun and Jason A. Hurley, was actually released more than a decade ago. As a piece of body horror, The Beauty delivers much like The Substance. (Fans of gore will be pleased to know that bones crack and creak, faces are ripped off, and teeth are ripped out.) But, while The Substance explored Hollywood and society’s resistance to aging, The Beauty casts a wider net and features characters wanting to overcome disease, reverse obesity, or have their appearance match their gender identity, touching on our obsession with semaglutide drugs like Ozempic, plastic surgery, and exercise culture. Unlike The Substance, which existed mainly as a psychological portrait of Moore’s character, The Beauty also points the mirror back at us, asking why we so revere the beautiful among us that characters here might actively seek out the STD, consequences be damned. In the show’s final episodes, as we watch two pretty teenage girls drive themselves to madness over why their noses don’t look like Kendall Jenner’s, we’re forced to wonder if our collective preoccupation with perfection may be the real virus among us.\n",
      "One of Murphy’s greatest assets has always been his ability to draw A-listers to work in his projects, and The Beauty is no different. Here, his most deranged and yet somehow inspired choices are Ashton Kutcher and Isabella Rossellini, playing the callous billionaire whose company developed the pathogen (and who treated himself to a pure sample of it) and his embittered wife, who prefers to let her haute couture be her contribution to beauty standards. There’s a fun element of self-awareness watching Kushner prep for an industry pitch like he’s playing Steve Jobs again, or hearing Rossellini espouse rhetoric that’s the opposite of her devilishly beautiful character in Death Becomes Her. (Her iconic bejeweled gown from that 1992 movie makes a late appearance, and yes, it’s delightful.)\n",
      "Still, The Beauty does have an unfortunate, if necessary, tendency to dangle amazing actors before us for an episode or two before eventually ripping them away and replacing them with no-name hotties. (I also found myself thinking how sad it must feel for Platt or Billy Eichner to think that no matter how much weight they lose or how much muscle they pack on, they are relegated to playing “Before” characters in a Ryan Murphy world.) As more of the ensemble gradually turn into literal models, we can find ourselves missing those who turned up to try to do some real acting. Still, maybe that’s the whole point? Some people, Rossellini’s character tells us, are perfect works of art precisely because their stretch marks signify lived experience.\n",
      "But it’s also here in its attempts to impart moral wisdom that The Beauty comes up firmly against some rather strong irony: How are we supposed to take seriously any sincere message about beauty standards from a series that delights in letting its camera linger over these nude beauties, or from a showrunner with a history of repeatedly casting a very specific type of handsome white man, and who let his last show be led by the likes of Kim Kardashian?\n",
      "Eventually, The Beauty morphs from a standard procedural into something more resembling a series of vignettes, with entire episodes devoted to backstories and side plots. Its characters start making nonsense choices, and its plot slowly goes off the rails as it races toward a desperate attempt to secure a second season through an unresolved cliffhanger. And yet, admittedly, if there were another episode, I would probably tune in. Hey, maybe I’m a sucker for beautiful people, or maybe I’m just happy to let this show be what it is. As Rossellini’s character asserts, “Once I learned that beauty is the answer to nothing, I became the happiest I’ve ever been.” \n",

      "Sean McDermott and the Buffalo Bills' coaching staff pushed the organization to draft Keon Coleman, according to team owner Terry Pegula, who defended Brandon Beane and attempted to explain the embattled executive's role in selecting the struggling wide receiver.\n",
      "As part of a wide-ranging news conference held Wednesday in the aftermath of McDermott's firing earlier this week, Beane was asked about the quality of the Bills' wide receivers and the performance of Coleman, a second-round draft pick in 2024.\n",
      "Beane, who was promoted to president of football operations on the same day McDermott was fired, was interrupted by Pegula before he could answer the question.\n",
      "\"I'll address the Keon situation. The coaching staff pushed to draft Keon,\" Pegula said. \"I'm not saying Brandon wouldn't have drafted him, but [Coleman] wasn't his next choice.\n",
      "\"That was Brandon being a team player and taking advice of his coaching staff who felt strongly about the player. And you know, he's taken -- for some reason -- heat over it, and not saying a word about it. But I'm here to tell you the true story.\"\n",
      "Coleman was selected by Buffalo with the 33rd overall pick in 2024 but has scuffled through two disappointing seasons with the Bills. The former Florida State star was disciplined by the team in November and was a healthy scratch for four games this season, also failing to eclipse 50 receiving yards in a game since the season opener.\n",
      "Beane attempted to clarify the selection process of Coleman later during Wednesday's news conference, insisting it \"was my pick.\"\n",
      "\"I made the pick,\" he said. \"Terry's point was that we might have had a different order of personnel versus coaching, and I went that way. But ultimately, I'm not turning a pick for a player that I don't think we can succeed with. So don't misunderstand that.\"\n",
      "Coleman, 22, had 38 catches for 404 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games this season. Beane acknowledged that the Bills must strengthen their wide receivers room, but also said he's not willing to give up on Coleman.\n",
      "\"Keon Coleman is a young player that has been here two years, has two years left on his deal,\" Beane said. \"It's up to us to work with him and develop him. His issues have not been on the field. They've just been maturity things that he owns. I give him credit. ... He doesn't make excuses, which I appreciate.\"\n",

      "Matthew Stafford knows he has his work cut out for him against Mike Macdonald's defense Sunday in Seattle.\n",
      "Joining Jim Gray on the Let’s Go! podcast earlier this week, Stafford was asked about facing the Seahawks for the third time this season.\n",
      "\"As good a defense as we faced all year,\" he said. \"They've got four guys they rotate on the outside, on edge rushers. They've got guys in the middle that are really, really talented players. Second-level players are great. Ernest (Jones IV) is having a hell of a year. And then in the secondary, they're long and fast and aggressive. It's a swarming group.\"\n",
      "History sides against Stafford this week.\n",
      "Sunday marks the first time a No. 1 scoring offense (Rams) will meet the No. 1 scoring defense (Seahawks) in a conference championship game since 2014, when Seattle's No. 1 D knocked off Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers No. 1 O.\n",
      "Since 1990, the No. 1 scoring offense is 0-4 versus the No. 1 scoring defense when they've met in the conference championship or Super Bowl (three of the four offenses had the NFL MVP). Two of those four wins by the top defense came from the Legion of Boom Seahawks -- 2014 versus Green Bay; Super Bowl XLVIII's shellacking of the Denver Broncos.\n",
      "Stafford doesn't just have to contend with a defense that has no discernible weakness, comes in waves and is led by a mastermind in Macdonald; there is also the renowned crowd noise.\n",
      "\"Oh, man, it's tough,\" he said of heading to Seattle. \"It is as good an atmosphere as there is in football. I can't imagine the NFC Championship not just exceeding those expectations. They do a great job of creating that home-field advantage. And you gotta go play in the elements there with their crowd and all that goes along with it but really, you're playing against the guys on the grass and that's as talented a football team as you'll see in the NFL. They've got a great roster top to bottom. I think they're really well coached. They play fast and physical.\"\n",
      "The Rams are the last team to beat Seattle, winning 21-19 in Week 11. L.A. then held a 30-14 fourth-quarter lead over the Seahawks in Week 16 before things crumbled into a 38-37 OT loss, which is why Sunday's tilt is in Seattle, not Los Angeles.\n",
      "In Week 16, Stafford generated 457 passing yards with three touchdown tosses and didn't turn the ball over, while the defense forced two Sam Darnold interceptions. However, three straight three-and-outs in the fourth quarter, two special teams blunders and a defense that couldn't get a stop late led to the loss. It was all of L.A.'s nightmares compiled in one fourth quarter.\n",
      "Turning 38 next month, Stafford said he's not yet interested in considering whether this is his last, best shot at getting that second Super Bowl ring.\n",
      "\"I try not to think about that kind of stuff,\" he said. \"I just try to enjoy the team that I'm on and the moment that I'm in. I love coming to work. I love the group that we get to do it with. These, like I said, opportunities don't come every single year, so I just try to live in 'em and cherish 'em when they're here. I sure hope it's not my last opportunity, but we'll see. You never know. Take these games and these seasons one at a time and figure it out from there. But I just know that I'm happy in the moment that I am right now doing what I'm doing.\"\n",
      "If Stafford can't puncture a Seattle defense that enters having allowed 10 or fewer points in each of its last three games, and five of their past seven, those questions will be asked in more earnest next week.\n",

      "Solar flares triggered by cascading magnetic avalanches, new observations reveal\n",
      "Gaby Clark\n",
      "scientific editor\n",
      "Robert Egan\n",
      "associate editor\n",
      "Just as avalanches on snowy mountains start with the movement of a small quantity of snow, the ESA-led Solar Orbiter spacecraft has discovered that a solar flare is triggered by initially weak disturbances that quickly become more violent. This rapidly evolving process creates a 'sky' of raining plasma blobs that continue to fall even after the flare subsides.\n",
      "The discovery was enabled by one of Solar Orbiter's most detailed views of a large solar flare, observed during the spacecraft's 30 September 2024 close approach to the sun. It is described in a paper being published on Wednesday 21 January in Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n",
      "Solar flares are powerful explosions on the sun. They occur when energy stored in tangled magnetic fields is suddenly released through a process described as \"reconnection.\" In a matter of minutes, criss-crossing magnetic field lines of opposite direction break and then reconnect. The newly reconnected field lines can quickly heat up and accelerate million-degree plasma, and even high-energy particles, away from the reconnection site, potentially creating a solar flare.\n",
      "The most powerful flares may start a chain of reactions that lead to geomagnetic storms on Earth, perhaps triggering radio blackouts, which is why it is so important to monitor and understand them.\n",
      "But the fine-grained details of how exactly this humongous amount of energy is released so rapidly has remained poorly understood. This unprecedented set of new Solar Orbiter observations—from four of the mission's instruments working in complement to provide the most complete picture of a solar flare ever made—finally has a compelling answer.\n",
      "High-resolution imagery from Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) zoomed in to features just a few hundred kilometers across in the sun's outer atmosphere (its corona), capturing changes every two seconds. Three other instruments—SPICE, STIX and PHI—analyzed a range of depths and temperature regimes, from the corona down to the sun's visible surface, or photosphere. Importantly, the observations enabled scientists to watch the buildup of events that led to the flare over the course of about 40 minutes.\n",
      "\"We were really very lucky to witness the precursor events of this large flare in such beautiful detail,\" says Pradeep Chitta of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Göttingen, Germany, and lead author of the paper. \"Such detailed high-cadence observations of a flare are not possible all the time because of the limited observational windows and because data like these take up so much memory space on the spacecraft's onboard computer. We really were in the right place at the right time to catch the fine details of this flare.\"\n",
      "Magnetic avalanche in action\n",
      "When EUI first started observing the region at 23:06 Universal Time (UT), about 40 minutes before peak flare activity, a dark arch-like 'filament' of twisted magnetic fields and plasma was already present, connected to a cross-shaped structure of progressively brightening magnetic field lines.\n",
      "Zooming in to this feature shows that new magnetic field strands appear in every image frame—equivalent to every two seconds or less. Each strand is magnetically contained, and they become twisted, like ropes.\n",
      "Then, just like in a typical avalanche, the region becomes unstable. The twisted strands begin to break and reconnect, rapidly triggering a cascade of further destabilizations in the area. This creates progressively stronger reconnection events and outflows of energy, seen as sudden and increasing brightness in the imagery.\n",
      "One particular brightening begins at 23:29 UT, followed by the dark filament disconnecting from one side, launching into space and at the same time violently unrolling at high speed. Bright sparks of reconnection are seen all along the filament in stunning high resolution as the main flare erupts at around 23:47 UT.\n",
      "\"These minutes before the flare are extremely important and Solar Orbiter gave us a window right into the foot of the flare where this avalanche process began,\" says Pradeep. \"We were surprised by how the large flare is driven by a series of smaller reconnection events that spread rapidly in space and time.\"\n",
      "Scientists had already proposed a simple avalanche model to explain the collective behavior of hundreds of thousands of flares on the sun and other stars, but it had not been clear whether a single large flare could be described by an avalanche. What this result shows is exactly that—a flare is not necessarily a single coherent eruption but can be a cascade of interacting reconnection events.\n",
      "Raining plasma blobs\n",
      "For the first time, and thanks to the simultaneous measurements by Solar Orbiter's SPICE and STIX instruments, Pradeep's team have been able to explore in extremely high resolution how the rapid series of reconnection events deposits energy in the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere.\n",
      "Of particular interest is high-energy X-ray emission, which is a signature of where accelerated particles have deposited their energy. Given that accelerated particles can escape into interplanetary space and pose radiation hazards to satellites, astronauts, and even Earth-based technologies, understanding how this process occurs is essential for forecasting.\n",
      "For the 30 September flare, the emission in ultraviolet to X-rays was already slowly rising when SPICE and STIX first started observing the region. The X-ray emission rose so dramatically during the flare itself—as reconnection events increased—that particles were accelerated to speeds of 40–50% the speed of light, equivalent to about 431–540 million km/h. Furthermore, the observations showed that the energy was transferred from the magnetic field to the surrounding plasma during these reconnection events.\n",
      "\"We saw ribbon-like features moving extremely quickly down through the sun's atmosphere, even before the main episode of the flare,\" says Pradeep. \"These streams of 'raining plasma blobs' are signatures of energy deposition, which get stronger and stronger as the flare progresses. Even after the flare subsides, the rain continues for some time. It's the first time we see this at this level of spatial and temporal detail in the solar corona.\"\n",
      "After the main phase of the flare, the original cross-shape of magnetic field lines is seen to relax in the EUI images, while STIX and SPICE saw the plasma start to cool down and particle emission decrease towards 'normal' levels. At the same time, PHI observed the imprint of the flare[NS1] on the sun's visible surface, completing the three-dimensional picture of the event.\n",
      "\"We didn't expect that the avalanche process could lead to such high energy particles,\" says Pradeep. \"We still have a lot to explore in this process, but that would need even higher resolution X-ray imagery from future missions to really disentangle.\"\n",
      "\"This is one of the most exciting results from Solar Orbiter so far,\" says Miho Janvier, ESA's Solar Orbiter co-Project Scientist. \"Solar Orbiter's observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasize the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work. An interesting prospect is whether this mechanism happens in all flares, and on other flaring stars.\"\n",
      "\"These exciting observations, captured in incredible detail and almost moment by moment, allowed us to see how a sequence of small events cascaded into giant bursts of energy,\" says David Pontin of the University of Newcastle, Australia, who co-authored the paper.\n",
      "He adds, \"By comparing the EUI observations with magnetic-field observations, we were able to disentangle the chain of events that led to the flare. What we observed challenges existing theories for flare energy release and, together with further observations, will allow us to refine those theories to improve our understanding.\"\n",

      "Challenging long-held assumptions, Aarhus University researchers have demonstrated that the protein building blocks essential for life as we know it can form readily in space. This discovery, appearing in Nature Astronomy, significantly raises the statistical probability of finding extraterrestrial life.\n",
      "In a modern laboratory at Aarhus University and at an international European facility in Hungary (HUN-REN Atomki), researchers Sergio Ioppolo and Alfred Thomas Hopkinson conduct pioneering experiments. Within a small chamber, the two scientists have mimicked the environment found in giant dust clouds thousands of light-years away. This is no easy feat.\n",
      "The temperature in these regions is a freezing -260° C. There is almost no pressure, meaning the researchers must constantly pump out gas particles to maintain an ultra-high vacuum. They are simulating these conditions to observe how the remaining particles react to radiation, exactly as they would in a real interstellar environment.\n",
      "\"We already know from earlier experiments that simple amino acids, like glycine, form in interstellar space. But we were interested in discovering if more complex molecules, like peptides, form naturally on the surface of dust grains before those take part in the formation of stars and planets,\" says Ioppolo.\n",
      "Peptides are amino acids bonded together in short chains. When peptides bond with one another, they form proteins, which are essential for life as we know it. Looking for the precursors to proteins is therefore vital in the search for the origin of life, Ioppolo explains.\n",
      "The two researchers placed glycine in the chamber, irradiated it with cosmic ray analogs produced by an ion accelerator at HUN-REN Atomki, and analyzed the results.\n",
      "\"We saw that the glycine molecules started reacting with each other to form peptides and water. This indicates that the same process occurs in interstellar space,\" Hopkinson says. \"This is a step toward proteins being created on dust particles, the same materials that later form rocky planets.\"\n",
      "Where stars are born\n",
      "Ioppolo, Hopkinson, and their colleagues at Aarhus University study and mimic the giant dust clouds between the stars because these are the birthplaces of new solar systems.\n",
      "\"We used to think that only very simple molecules could be created in these clouds. The understanding was that more complex molecules formed much later, once the gases had begun coalescing into a disk that eventually becomes a star,\" Ioppolo explains. \"But we have shown that this is clearly not the case.\"\n",
      "The discovery is significant because it suggests that these essential molecules are far more abundant in the universe than previously believed.\n",
      "\"Eventually, these gas clouds collapse into stars and planets. Bit by bit, these tiny building blocks land on rocky planets within a newly formed solar system. If those planets happen to be in the habitable zone, then there is a real probability that life might emerge,\" Ioppolo explains.\n",
      "\"That said, we still don't know exactly how life began. But research like ours shows that many of the complex molecules necessary for life are created naturally in space.\"\n",
      "A universal reaction\n",
      "It might seem like a minor discovery that peptides form naturally from the simplest amino acids in space. However, the chemical process through which amino acids bond is universal. This suggests that the same reaction likely occurs with other, more complex amino acids as well, explains Hopkinson.\n",
      "\"All types of amino acids bond into peptides through the same reaction. It is therefore very likely that other peptides naturally form in interstellar space as well,\" says Hopkinson. \"We haven't looked into this yet, but we are likely to do so in the future.\"\n",
      "Amino acids and peptides are not the only building blocks essential to life; membranes, nucleobases, and nucleotides are necessary as well. Whether these also form naturally in space remains unknown, but Ioppolo, Hopkinson, and their colleagues at the Center for Interstellar Catalysis are working hard to find out.\n",
      "\"These molecules are some of the key building blocks of life,\" explained co-author Professor Liv Hornekær, the InterCat center leader. \"They might actively participate in early prebiotic chemistry, catalyzing further reactions that lead toward life.\"\n",
      "\"There's still a lot to be discovered, but our research team is working on answering as many of these basic questions as possible,\" Ioppolo says. \"We've already discovered that many of the building blocks of life are formed out there, and we'll likely find more in the future.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON — NASA is ending financial support for several planetary science groups as part of a broader drawdown of the agency’s advisory structure.\n",
      "In a Jan. 16 letter, Louise Prockter, director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division (PSD), informed the leaders of eight organizations known as assessment or analysis groups — collectively called AGs — that the agency will end funding for them by the end of April.\n",
      "“Several recent changes in the NASA landscape, however, make continuing the current support and operations model infeasible,” Prockter wrote, citing executive orders, the elimination of other advisory committees and a “highly constrained” planetary science budget.\n",
      "She said NASA considered several options for continuing support. “Unfortunately, despite the recognized value of the AGs, PSD can no longer formally support the AGs,” she wrote.\n",
      "The AGs focus on specific topics in planetary science, ranging from the moon to the outer solar system. The groups typically meet one or more times a year to discuss missions, research and related issues, providing input to NASA. Many also conduct studies at the agency’s request.\n",
      "“SBAG facilitates and mediates the relationship between the small bodies and planetary defense science and technology communities; identifies, collects, and represents the priorities of these communities; and acts as a bridge between the small bodies community and NASA,” the Small Bodies Assessment Group says on its website. The group met last week.\n",
      "Speaking at a Jan. 20 meeting of the National Academies’ Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science, Prockter said NASA is not abolishing the AGs. “We are simply not able to support them for a number of reasons,” she said, referring to her letter.\n",
      "The groups may continue operating without NASA funding. “Several of the AGs have let us know they do intend to continue. They will self-organize,” she said. “They might look a little bit different. Maybe they’ll change their names. But they do intend to continue.”\n",
      "She added that NASA might be able to provide some “small support” for the AGs that do continue, such as covering travel for students attending AG meetings.\n",
      "NASA’s decision to end its current level of support for the AGs is not surprising. Shortly after the start of the second Trump administration a year ago, NASA instructed the AGs to halt their activities “to review and ensure compliance with presidential actions.” That caused several of the groups to cancel or postpone meetings.\n",
      "NASA later allowed the AGs to resume activities in the spring, but many in the planetary science community anticipated that support could eventually be reduced or eliminated.\n",
      "The move is part of a broader effort by NASA and other federal agencies to reduce the number of advisory committees. The AGs previously provided findings to the Planetary Science Advisory Committee, which NASA abolished last year along with advisory committees in astrophysics, Earth science and heliophysics.\n",
      "NASA said it would replace those committees with a single science advisory committee representing all disciplines, but it has not announced the committee’s membership or meeting plans.\n",
      "NASA’s flagship advisory body, the NASA Advisory Council, has not met since the start of the current administration, and its subcommittees covering areas such as exploration and space technology have also not convened.\n",
      "“To see those things sort of put on hold, if you will, while they are examined or their charters are reviewed is very, very worrisome,” Lester Lyles, chairman of the NASA Advisory Council, said last July.\n",
      "He argued that advisory groups are even more important given upheaval in the federal workforce, including the departure of roughly 20% of NASA’s civil servant workforce through early resignation programs. “Those advisory groups, peopled by the right kinds of individuals and leadership, can play a more important role,” he said.\n",
      "Some advisory committees have continued to operate. The congressionally mandated Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel holds quarterly public meetings, and the International Space Station Advisory Committee also met last year.\n",
      "Other federal agencies have taken similar steps. Last August, the Federal Aviation Administration removed the entire membership of its Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee, known as COMSTAC, which had advised the agency on commercial launch issues since 1984. The FAA has not reconstituted COMSTAC or announced future plans for the committee. \n",

      "Robert Egan\n",
      "associate editor\n",
      "Bacteriophages have been used therapeutically to treat infectious bacterial diseases for over a century. As antibiotic-resistant infections increasingly threaten public health, interest in bacteriophages as therapeutics has seen a resurgence. However, the field remains largely limited to naturally occurring strains, as laborious strain engineering techniques have limited the pace of discovery and the creation of tailored therapeutic strains.\n",
      "Now, researchers from New England Biolabs (NEB) and Yale University describe the first fully synthetic bacteriophage engineering system for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium of global concern, in a new Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) study. The system is enabled by NEB's High-Complexity Golden Gate Assembly (HC-GGA) platform.\n",
      "In this method, researchers engineer bacteriophages synthetically using sequence data rather than bacteriophage isolates. The team assembled a P. aeruginosa phage from 28 synthetic fragments, and programmed it with new behaviors through point mutations, DNA insertions and deletions. These modifications included swapping tail fiber genes to alter the bacterial host range and inserting fluorescent reporters to visualize infection in real time.\n",
      "\"Even in the best of cases, bacteriophage engineering has been extremely labor-intensive. Researchers spent entire careers developing processes to engineer specific model bacteriophages in host bacteria,\" reflects Andy Sikkema, the paper's co-first author and Research Scientist at NEB. \"This synthetic method offers technological leaps in simplicity, safety and speed, paving the way for biological discoveries and therapeutic development.\"\n",
      "A new approach to bacteriophage engineering\n",
      "With NEB's Golden Gate Assembly platform, scientists can build an entire phage genome based on digital sequence data outside the cell, piece by piece, with any intended edits already included. The genome is assembled directly from synthetic DNA and introduced into a safe laboratory strain.\n",
      "The method removes long-standing challenges of relying on the propagation of physical phage isolates and specialized strains of host bacteria, a heightened challenge for therapeutically-relevant phages, which specifically infect human pathogens. In addition, the process removes the need for labor‑intensive screening or iterative editing required by in-cell engineering methods.\n",
      "Unlike DNA assembly methods that join fewer and longer DNA fragments, Golden Gate Assembly's segments are shorter, making them less toxic to host cells, easier to prepare, and much less likely to contain errors. The method is also less sensitive to the repeats and extreme GC content found in many phage genomes.\n",
      "Through simplification and increased versatility, the Golden Gate method of bacteriophage engineering dramatically shifts the window of possibilities for researchers dedicated to developing bacteriophages as therapeutic agents to overcome antibiotic resistance.\n",
      "Molecular tools finding their purpose\n",
      "Realizing the rapid method of synthetic bacteriophage engineering required an intersection of expertise between NEB's scientists, who developed the basic tools to make Golden Gate reliable for large targets and many DNA fragments, and bacteriophage researchers at Yale University who recognized its potential, and reached out to collaborate on new, ambitious applications.\n",
      "Researchers at NEB first worked to optimize the method in a model phage, Escherichia coli phage T7. Since then, partnering teams have worked with NEB scientists to expand the method to non-model bacteriophages that target highly antibiotic-resistant pathogens.\n",
      "A related study, which used the Golden Gate method to synthesize high-GC content Mycobacterium phages, was published in PNAS in November 2025 in conjunction with the Hatfull Lab at the University of Pittsburgh and Ansa Biotechnologies. Researchers from Cornell University have also worked with NEB to develop a method to synthetically engineer T7 bacteriophages as biosensors capable of detecting E. coli in drinking water, described in a December 2025 ACS study.\n",
      "\"My lab builds 'weird hammers' and then looks for the right nails,\" said Greg Lohman, Senior Principal Investigator at NEB and co-author on the study. \"In this case, the phage therapy community told us, 'That's exactly the hammer we've been waiting for.'\"\n",

      "Although death rates from heart disease have dropped for the first time in the past five years, it still kills more Americans than any other condition, according to the report, published early Wednesday in the journal Circulation.\n",
      "Annual heart disease deaths decreased by 2.7% between 2022 and 2023 -- from 941,652 to 915,973, according to the report. However, cardiovascular disease still killed more people in the U.S. than cancer and accidents combined.\n",
      "Deaths related to blockages in the coronary arteries, which are blood vessels that wrap around the heart's surface, decreased by 5.9% from 371,506 to 349,470 over the same period, the report found.\n",
      "Coronary artery disease often leads to a heart attack, with two people dying of coronary heart disease every three minutes, the report noted.\n",
      "Other chronic conditions that damage blood vessels and increase risks for heart disease are also common among Americans, according to the report.\n",
      "The percentage of U.S. adults with high blood pressure increased slightly to 47.3% while the rate of obesity decreased slightly to 50%, the report found. However, obesity is on the rise among the younger generation -- increasing from 25.4% to 28.1% among those between ages 2 and 19, according to the report.\n",
      "Prevention, including addressing risk factors, remains key in reducing heart disease deaths, Dr. Sadiya Khan, a board-certified cardiologist at Northwestern and vice chair of the volunteer committee behind the report, told ABC News.\n",
      "\"We cannot cure heart disease and so, if we wait until symptoms are present, we are left with trying to manage symptoms and treat, which saves lives but the yield of prevention is even greater,\" she said.\n",
      "There are four lifestyle behaviors and four health metrics essential for heart health, according to the AHA report. These include healthy eating, physical activity, sleeping well and quitting tobacco as well as controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar and blood pressure.\n",
      "Addressing these eight factors could prevent up to 40% of heart disease deaths and lower the risk of developing major heart disease symptoms by up to 74%, according to a 2024 analysis from researchers in the Netherlands and Sweden.\n",
      "Those same preventative measures have benefits beyond the heart, Khan pointed out. They can also help slow brain aging and lower the risk for dementia. Managing blood pressure is especially helpful against cognitive decline, she added.\n",
      "Reducing cardiovascular disease in the U.S. could improve the health of not just the general public but also the health of the economy, Dr. Jennifer Miao, a board-certified Yale cardiologist and ABC Medical Unit fellow, told ABC News.\n",
      "\"We're seeing an incredible financial burden of cardiovascular disease on the U.S. economy, with an estimated average of $414.7 billion in direct and indirect costs of treating cardiovascular disease from 2021 to 2022,\" she said.\n",
      "Despite the well-documented positive effects from good lifestyle habits, getting Americans to focus on their cardiovascular health has been an uphill battle, Khan said.\n",
      "For example, only one in four US adults currently meet national guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercise. Additionally, only 43.5% of Americans with type 2 diabetes have their condition under control, according to the report.\n",
      "\"Staying physically active and engaging in regular exercise routines to the best of your ability are day-to-day goals that can significantly impact your overall health,\" Miao said. \"Talk to your health care provider about any questions you might have on safe exercise plans and appropriate health screenings that are suited for you as an individual.\"\n",

      "Venezuela has accused US President Donald Trump of making a \"colonialist threat\" after he said the airspace around the country should be considered closed.\n",
      "The country's foreign ministry called Trump's comments \"another extravagant, illegal and unjustified aggression against the Venezuelan people\".\n",
      "The US does not legally have the authority to close another country's airspace, but Trump's online post could lead to travel uncertainty and deter airlines from operating there.\n",
      "The US has been building its military presence in the Caribbean, which officials say is to combat drug smuggling. Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has dismissed US claims of drug trafficking as an attempt to oust him.\n",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote: \"To all Airlines, Pilots, Drug Dealers, and Human Traffickers, please consider THE AIRSPACE ABOVE AND SURROUNDING VENEZUELA TO BE CLOSED IN ITS ENTIRETY.\"\n",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n",
      "Trump's comments come days after the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned airlines of \"heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".\n",
      "Venezuela on Wednesday banned six major international airlines – Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines – from landing there after they failed to meet a 48-hour deadline to resume flights.\n",
      "The US has deployed the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and about 15,000 troops to within striking distance of Venezuela.\n",
      "It has insisted that the deployment – the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989 – is to combat drug trafficking.\n",
      "On Thursday, Trump warned that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\".\n",
      "US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they said were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. However, the US has not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs.\n",
      "The Venezuelan government believes the aim of the US action is to depose Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged.\n",
      "The US has also designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns – a group it alleges is headed by Maduro – as a foreign terrorist organisation.\n",
      "Labelling an organisation as a terrorist group gives US law enforcement and military agencies broader powers to target and dismantle it.\n",
      "Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation.\n",
      "Venezuela's interior and justice minister Diosdado Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has long called it an \"invention\".\n",
      "The US state department has insisted that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists, but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's military, intelligence, legislature, and judiciary\".\n"

      "FDA to raise hurdles for vaccines, faulting COVID shots for 10 kids' deaths\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration intends to get tougher on vaccine approvals, as top officials raised concerns about the risk of COVID vaccines for children.\n",
      "Speaking on Fox News Saturday morning, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would no longer \"rubber-stamp new products that don't work,\" claiming it made a \"mockery of science.\"\n",
      "Makary's comments came the day after FDA's top vaccine regulator, Dr. Vinay Prasad, told his team the agency would change its annual flu vaccine framework, update vaccine labels to be \"honest,\" and make other changes to how it reviews vaccines, according to contents of an internal email reviewed by NPR and reported on first by a PBS News Hour correspondent and later by The Washington Post.\n",
      "Prasad wrote that the FDA would also no longer authorize vaccines for pregnant women without stricter requirements. And for pneumonia vaccines, manufacturers will have to prove they reduce disease rather than show they generate antibodies. He also raised questions about giving multiple vaccines at the same time, which is standard practice.\n",
      "The changes could make it much more difficult and expensive for vaccines to get approved, further limiting the availability of vaccines, which are considered among the safest and most effective tools for protecting people against infectious diseases.\n",
      "While all vaccines carry some risks, most public health experts argue the current process for vetting vaccines before marketing has long assured that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks. Studies required after vaccines are approved and surveillance systems, including the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), also flag potential safety issues once vaccines are in use.\n",
      "FDA says an analysis links COVID shots to some deaths\n",
      "Makary said on Fox News that 10 children had died from the COVID shot during the Biden administration, but did not offer specifics about how the FDA came to that conclusion. Millions of children have received the vaccine.\n",
      "Officials with the Department of Health and Human Services and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the COVID analysis and changes to vaccine review standards.\n",
      "According to the FDA email from Prasad, he told the agency's biostatistics and pharmacovigilance team to analyze 96 reported deaths from 2021 to 2024, and they determined 10 children died \"after and because of\" the COVID vaccine. But Prasad said the true number was likely higher.\n",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a text message that Prasad has not shared the evidence that these vaccines killed 10 children.\n",
      "\"Because he doesn't provide any evidence, he is asking us to trust him on an important issue,\" Office said. \"All this will do is scare people unnecessarily. At the very least, he should provide all the evidence he has so that experts in the field can review it and decide whether he has enough data to prove his point.\"\n",
      "Dr. Jesse Goodman, a professor at Georgetown University who held Prasad's job at FDA from 2003 until 2009, said in an email that the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which oversees vaccine approval, has been \"recognized globally as a gold standard regulator.\" Goodman defended \"immunologic endpoints like antibody levels\" for the accelerated approval of pneumonia and influenza vaccines. He said science supports their use and they are confirmed with studies after approval: \"These approaches have helped provide children and adults with timely access to safe and effective vaccines, saving many lives.\"\n",
      "Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota, reviewed the email from Prasad and challenged his statement that \"COVID-19 was never highly lethal for children.\" Osterholm also questioned the FDA's latest analysis of adverse event reports attributing the 10 deaths to COVID vaccines.\n",
      "\"Prasad's email is filled with factual mistakes and misrepresents both the severity of COVID in children (1597 deaths in 2020-2022) and how the US responded to the first signals of possible vaccine-associated pediatric deaths in May 2021,\" Osterholm wrote in an email to NPR.\n",
      "\"While Prasad's email notes 10 such deaths, these cases have never been presented for review by the medical and public health communities or published in the medical literature,\" Osterholm continued. \"Given the record of this Administration to misrepresent scientific data regarding vaccines, until these cases have been reviewed by an expert third party, like the National Academy of Science[s], we can not accept the fact they are vaccine-associated deaths.\"\n",
      "Surveillance system collects vaccines reports\n",
      "The FDA makes public data from the VAERS surveillance system co-sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But FDA cautions, \"it is important to note that for any reported event, no cause and effect relationship has been established.\" In his email, Prasad wrote that \"with case reports, causality is typically assessed on a subjective scale. In this scale ranging from certain to unlikely -- certain, possible/likely, and probable are broadly considered as related to the product.\"\n",
      "Makary said on Fox News that when the COVID shot was first rolled out, it was \"amazing\" for people at high risk of coming down with severe disease, but things have changed.\n",
      "\"Back in 2020, we saw a reduction in the severity of illness and lives saved, but now recommending that a 6-year-old girl get another 70 million COVID shots – one each year for the rest of her life – is not based on science. And so we're not going to just rubber stamp approvals without seeing some scientific evidence.\"\n",
      "The claim is the latest move by Trump administration health officials questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and how the government has regulated them. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned vaccines.\n",
      "The FDA restricted eligibility for the updated COVID vaccines in August after announcing the agency planned to require more evidence about the shots' safety and effectiveness going forward.\n",
      "CDC committee will meet to review vaccine policies\n",
      "The FDA email on vaccine policy comes just before the CDC convenes a crucial two-day meeting of that agency's influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Dec. 4-5. The committee is in the process of conducting a major review of how children are inoculated against dangerous infectious diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio and hepatitis B.\n",
      "Many public health experts are concerned the committee will upend the childhood vaccination schedule. It could move to delay the timing of some inoculations, space out vaccinations and call for the reformulation of some vaccines. Taken together, the moves could result in fewer children getting protected and the resurgence of once-vanquished diseases.\n",
      "Asked about Makary and Prasad's claims that the COVID vaccine caused deaths among 10 children, Moderna, whose COVID vaccine is approved for children as young as 6 months old, pointed to a statement it made in September. The company says that multiple published, peer-reviewed studies from a variety of sources show its shot is safe and that it is \"not aware of any deaths in the last year or pertinent new information from prior years.\"\n",
      "Moderna says it monitors its vaccine's safety along with regulators in more than 90 countries. \"With more than one billion doses distributed globally, these systems — including in national health systems across Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. — have not reported any new or undisclosed safety concerns in children or in pregnant women.\"\n",
      "Pfizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n"
